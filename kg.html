            <h2>Kindergarten Introduction</h2>
            <p>Our all-day Kindergarten program allows for a very rich, challenging and comprehensive curriculum.  There is enough time for not only academic instruction, but also the equally important free play which promotes motor coordination, sharing and socialization.</p>
            <p><strong>Staff</strong>  &mdash; Our Kindergarten is staffed by a fully-credentialed teacher and a full-time instructional aide.</p>
            <p><strong>Religion</strong>  &mdash; In addition to learning many Bible stories, St. Vincent Ferrer School Kindergartners learn that God loves them.  They learn basic prayers and present a special Kindergarten nativity pageant in December.</p>
            <p><strong>Reading </strong>  &mdash; St. Vincent Ferrer School uses the phonics-based Kindergarten series programs.</p>
            <p><strong>Handwriting </strong>  &mdash; The D’Nealian Method of handwriting is taught because it has proven most effective in the later transition to cursive.</p>
            <p><strong>Mathematics </strong>  &mdash; Students will recognize and understand the numerals 1 to 20, learn about comparisons, the calendar, the clock, money, measurement, sets, and geometric shapes.</p>
            <p><strong>Free Play Time </strong>&mdash; Children play both indoors and outdoors, promoting motor coordination, imagination, fair play, sharing and sportsmanship.</p>
            <p><strong>Science </strong>&mdash; Students are introduced to plant and animal life through thematic learning activities.</p>
            <p><strong>Communication Skills/Drama </strong>&mdash; All Kindergarteners participate in both school and classroom drama productions .  They also practice public speaking at the morning assemblies.</p>
            <p><strong>Music </strong>&mdash; In addition to responding to music through movement in the Kindergarten classroom, students also attend formal music classes taught by the choral director in the school’s music room.</p>
            <p><strong>Physical Education </strong>&mdash; Under the direction of the school’s full-time P.E. teacher, students attend regular physical education classes.  They learn skills in games, team play and gross and fine motor coordination.</p>
            <p><strong>Art </strong>&mdash; To channel creative expression, children paint, draw and construct using line, color and form.  </p>
            <p><strong>Library Time </strong>&mdash; To cultivate a love of reading, Kindergarteners are introduced to the library through story-time sessions with the school’s librarian.  Children also check out and bring home books from the school library.</p>

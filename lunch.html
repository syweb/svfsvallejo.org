            <h2>Lunch</h2>
            <p>Since the morning school session is longer, we advise parents to give children something extra in their lunches so that it can be eaten as snack.  Well-balanced and nutritious meals are essential to the health and performance of the students. <strong> Fast food is not allowed at school. </strong>If you wish your child to go home for lunch, a note must be presented to that effect.  No child will be given permission to go to a local store at lunchtime, or any other time. </p>
            <p>Students must bring their lunches to school with them.  If a student has forgotten his or her lunch, the lunch needs to be brought to the office by 9:30 a.m.  Milk is available for purchase on a daily basis. </p>
            <h3>Café St. Vincent</h3>
            <p>The Café St. Vincent is provided by the Parents and Friends Club and sells the various food items to students for a nominal fee.  As in the past, the Café is always looking to vary its menu and, with the help of parent volunteers, may extend its days of operation.  Your Family Envelope will have information about the Café during the first week of school.  In the meantime, students must bring their own lunches. </p>
            <p>Ordinarily, pizzas are offered on Thursdays and are sponsored by individual classes as fundraisers.  Order forms will be included in the Wednesday envelope and need to be returned by that Friday.   Pizza Thursday is separate from the Café St. Vincent and a separate check must be written. </p>
            <p>Again, the Café and Pizza Thursdays usually begin the second or third week of school.  Please check your family envelope for details.</p>
